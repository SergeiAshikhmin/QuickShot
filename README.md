## Controls  
  
    You can use the WASD keys to move, space to jump, and the mouse to aim the weapon. Clicking will fire the weapon in the direction you want to shoot! Last minute, a bug arose which flipped the players weapon when turning to the left. This will fire the weapon from the other end. We apologize for this, it was a last minute issue that we were unable to solve. The game still works, just not as smooth as intended.  
    
    Each weapon has its own reloading mechanic. The Pistol and Assault Rifle will reload all at once, the shotgun reloads by shell, and the laser pistol has a charge and overheat mechanic. The bow doesn't reload, but has the longest firing time. Each weapon has a different push value, use the weapons to the best of your abilities to defeat enemies and complete the platforming challenges!  
      
    The biggest mechanic in the game is the push. Firing your weapon will launch you in the opposite direction. Time your shots, learn how to manage your individual ammo types, and enjoy Quickshot!
